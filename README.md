# Card Deck Challenge

To run the steps of the challenge, run this command:
```
clojure -M -m card-challenge.core
```

See `results.txt` for the output from a previous run.

Note I didn't write tests for this code, simply because that would take more time for me to complete, and I assume it's not a requirement.
